# Unity Scenes for Humanoid Robotics Simulation

This directory contains Unity scenes for humanoid robotics simulation. Unity provides advanced visualization and environment modeling capabilities that complement physics-accurate simulation with Gazebo.

## Scene Structure

Unity scenes would typically include:
- Environment models (rooms, furniture, obstacles)
- Character controllers for humanoid robots
- Sensor simulation setups
- Lighting and material configurations
- Animation controllers for humanoid movements

## Integration with ROS 2

Unity scenes would integrate with ROS 2 through:
- Unity Robotics Hub packages
- ROS-TCP-Connector for communication
- URDF Importer for robot models
- Sensor simulation plugins

## Requirements

- Unity 2022.3 LTS or later
- Unity Robotics Hub package
- ROS-TCP-Connector package
- URDF Importer package

## Setup Instructions

1. Install Unity Hub and Unity Editor (2022.3 LTS)
2. Import Unity Robotics Hub package
3. Import ROS-TCP-Connector package
4. Import URDF Importer package
5. Configure ROS connection settings

For detailed setup instructions, refer to the Unity Robotics documentation.
