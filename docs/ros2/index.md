# ROS 2 - Robotic Nervous System

Welcome to the ROS 2 fundamentals module. This section establishes the communication backbone for humanoid robots using the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), the middleware that enables all other systems to work together.

## Overview

The Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) serves as the nervous system for humanoid robots, providing the communication infrastructure that connects sensors, actuators, perception systems, and control algorithms. This module covers the essential concepts needed to develop complex humanoid robotics applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:

- How to design distributed robotic systems using ROS 2 concepts
- The fundamentals of nodes, topics, services, and actions
- How to model robots using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
- How to integrate Python with ROS 2 for rapid prototyping
- Practical examples of ROS 2 applications in humanoid robotics

## Module Structure

This module is organized into several key sections:

### 1. Introduction to ROS 2 and Physical AI
Explore the role of ROS 2 in embodied intelligence and how it addresses the unique challenges of physical AI systems.

### 2. Nodes, Topics, and Services
Master the fundamental communication patterns in ROS 2, including publish-subscribe and request-response mechanisms.

### 3. URDF Modeling for Humanoid Robots
Learn to create accurate robot models that represent the physical structure and kinematic properties of humanoid robots.

### 4. Python Integration with ROS 2
Discover how to leverage Python's rich ecosystem within the ROS 2 framework for rapid development and AI integration.

### 5. Practical ROS 2 Examples
Apply your knowledge with real-world examples specifically tailored for humanoid robotics applications.
