# Capstone Project - Autonomous Humanoid Robot

This capstone project integrates all the concepts learned in the previous modules to create an autonomous humanoid robot capable of voice-to-action, object recognition, navigation, and manipulation tasks.

## Project Overview

The capstone project demonstrates the complete pipeline of a humanoid robot system:

- **Voice Command Processing**: Using VLA systems to interpret natural language commands
- **Perception**: Object recognition and scene understanding using AI models
- **Navigation**: Path planning and obstacle avoidance using Nav2
- **Manipulation**: Object grasping and manipulation using robotic arms

## Learning Objectives

By completing this capstone project, students will be able to:

1. Integrate all four core modules (ROS 2, Digital Twin, AI-Robot Brain, VLA) into a cohesive system
2. Implement voice-controlled robot navigation and manipulation
3. Deploy AI models for real-time perception and decision making
4. Understand the complete pipeline from high-level commands to low-level robot control

## Prerequisites

Before starting this capstone project, ensure you have completed:

- ROS 2 fundamentals module
- Simulation environments module
- AI integration module
- VLA systems module

## Project Structure

The capstone project is organized into several components:

- Project outline and requirements
- Complete implementation guide
- Integration code combining all modules
- Testing and validation procedures
