# Simulation & Digital Twin Implementation

Welcome to the simulation and digital twin module. This section covers the essential techniques for creating accurate virtual environments that enable safe testing and development of humanoid robotics applications before deployment to real hardware.

## Overview

Simulation environments serve as digital twins for humanoid robots, providing safe, cost-effective, and repeatable testing platforms. This module explores both Gazebo for physics-accurate simulation and Unity for advanced visualization and environment modeling.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:

- How to create accurate physics simulations for humanoid robots
- Techniques for sensor integration in simulation environments
- Methods for transferring knowledge from simulation to real hardware (sim-to-real)
- Best practices for digital twin implementation in robotics

## Module Structure

This module is organized into several key sections:

### 1. Introduction to Digital Twins
Explore the concept of digital twins and their importance in robotics development and testing.

### 2. Gazebo Physics Simulation
