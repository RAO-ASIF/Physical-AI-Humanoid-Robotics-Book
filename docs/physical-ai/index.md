# Physical AI Fundamentals

Welcome to the Physical AI fundamentals module. This section establishes the theoretical foundation for understanding how artificial intelligence systems operate in physical spaces and interact with real-world environments.

## Overview

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from traditional digital AI systems to embodied intelligence that must navigate, perceive, and act in the physical world. This module covers the core concepts that differentiate Physical AI from conventional AI applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:

- The fundamental differences between digital and physical AI systems
- How embodiment influences intelligent behavior
- The challenges of real-time decision making in uncertain environments
- The role of simulation in developing physical AI systems
- Safety considerations in physical AI applications

## Module Structure

This module is organized into two main sections:

### 1. Physical AI Fundamentals
Explore the theoretical foundations of Physical AI, including embodiment, real-time constraints, and uncertainty management.

### 2. Physical AI Applications
Examine real-world applications of Physical AI across robotics, autonomous vehicles, and embodied AI systems.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Basic understanding of AI and machine learning concepts
- Familiarity with Python programming
- Understanding of basic physics concepts (motion, force, energy)

## Next Steps

Continue to the [Physical AI Fundamentals](./fundamentals.md) section to explore the theoretical foundations of embodied intelligence.
