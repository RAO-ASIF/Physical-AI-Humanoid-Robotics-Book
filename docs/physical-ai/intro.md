# Introduction to Physical AI

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This comprehensive guide covers the integration of digital intelligence with physical humanoid robots using ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, Unity, and LLM integration.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to the integration of artificial intelligence with physical systems, particularly robots that interact with the real world. Unlike traditional AI that operates purely in digital spaces, Physical AI must handle the complexities of the physical world including:

- Real-time sensor data processing
- Physical constraints and dynamics
- Uncertainty in perception and action
- Safety considerations in human environments

## Course Structure

This textbook is organized into four core modules:

1. **Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - The communication backbone
2. **Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Simulation environments
3. **AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)** - Perception and planning
4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Human-robot interaction

Each module builds upon the previous ones, culminating in a comprehensive capstone project.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Design and implement ROS 2 systems for humanoid robots
- Create and use digital twins for safe testing
- Integrate AI systems for perception and planning
- Implement voice-command interfaces for robot control
- Combine all components in a complete humanoid robot system
