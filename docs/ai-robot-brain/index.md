# AI-Robot Brain Integration

Welcome to the AI-robot brain integration module. This section covers the essential techniques for integrating artificial intelligence systems with humanoid robots, creating intelligent decision-making capabilities that form the robot's cognitive core.

## Overview

The AI-robot brain represents the intelligent decision-making system of a humanoid robot. This module covers perception, navigation, planning, and cognitive systems that enable robots to understand their environment, make decisions, and execute complex tasks.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:

- How to implement perception systems for environment understanding
- Techniques for visual simultaneous localization and mapping (VSLAM)
- Nav2 path planning for navigation tasks
- Practical AI integration examples for humanoid robotics

## Module Structure

This module is organized into several key sections:

### 1. Introduction to AI in Robotics
Explore the role of AI in humanoid robotics and how intelligent systems enhance robot capabilities.

### 2. Perception Systems
Master computer vision and sensor processing techniques for environment understanding.

### 3. VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
Learn advanced techniques for creating maps while simultaneously determining robot location.

### 4. Nav2 Path Planning
Implement navigation systems using the ROS 2 navigation stack for autonomous movement.

### 5. Practical AI Integration Examples
Apply your knowledge with real-world examples of AI integration in humanoid robotics.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts
- ROS 2 fundamentals (covered in Module 2)
- Basic knowledge of computer vision
- Python programming experience
- Ubuntu 22.04 with ROS 2 Humble and necessary AI libraries installed
