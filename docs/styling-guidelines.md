# Textbook Styling and Formatting Guidelines

## Document Structure

Each chapter should follow this standard structure:

```
---
title: Chapter Title
sidebar_label: Chapter X - Title
description: Brief description of the chapter content
---

# Chapter Title

## Learning Objectives
[4-6 specific, measurable objectives]

## Table of Contents
[List of main sections with links]

[Main content with appropriate headings]

## Chapter Summary
[Brief summary of key concepts]

## Exercises
[3-5 practical exercises]

## Further Reading
[Relevant resources and documentation]

## Assessment
[Questions to test understanding]
```

## Typography and Formatting

### Headings
- H1: Chapter title (single per document)
- H2: Major sections
- H3: Subsections
- H4: Detailed subsections (use sparingly)

### Code Blocks
- Use appropriate language identifiers: `python`, `bash`, `xml`, `yaml`, etc.
- Keep examples concise but complete
- Add explanatory comments where necessary
- Use realistic variable names and examples

### Lists
- Use bullet points for unordered lists
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Limit list items to one concept per item
- Use consistent terminology within lists

## Content Guidelines

### Writing Style
- Write for university students, researchers, and educators
- Use clear, concise language
- Define technical terms when first introduced
- Include practical examples and use cases
- Provide hands-on exercises for each concept

### Educational Elements
- Include learning objectives at the start of each chapter
- Add chapter summaries highlighting key concepts
- Provide assessment questions to test understanding
- Include real-world applications and case studies
- Add references to further reading and documentation

## Technical Standards

### Code Examples
- All code must be tested and verified
- Include error handling where appropriate
- Follow language-specific best practices
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Include comments explaining complex logic

### Citations
- Follow APA 7th edition format
- Include at least 10 credible sources per chapter
- Verify all sources are current and accessible
- Distinguish between academic and technical sources
- Include DOIs or stable URLs where available

## Visual Elements

### Diagrams and Images
- Use diagrams to explain complex concepts
- Ensure images are high resolution and properly licensed
- Include alt text for accessibility
- Reference diagrams within the text
- Maintain consistent style across all visuals

### Tables
- Use tables for comparison or structured data
- Include descriptive captions
- Format consistently throughout the textbook
- Limit table width to page constraints
- Use tables for reference materials when appropriate

## Quality Assurance

### Review Process
- Verify all examples reproduce successfully
- Check for technical accuracy against official documentation
- Ensure consistent terminology throughout
- Validate all links and references
- Confirm accessibility standards are met

### Testing Requirements
- All code examples should run without modification
- Examples should work in both simulation and real environments
- Verify compatibility with specified versions of tools
- Test on multiple platforms when applicable
- Document any platform-specific considerations
